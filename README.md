# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis:
    - After completing a ride_sharing business analysis for PyBer, requested by CEO we're jumped into reviewing a big set of data by city type to illustrate a sum of weekly fares for each of those three cities (Urban, Suburban, and Rural). In this analysis we have used tools such as: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotib, pandas, etc.

Results:
    - The first step was to Merge two DataFrames into one (Ride_data_df and City_data_df)
    Then we've completed some formulas to get a summary DataFrame for each city type, such as: finding the total rider, drivers, amount of fares, fare per ride, fare per driver, and summary.
    In Deliverable 2, we used groupby function to create and new DataFrame to illustrate the sum of all fares with the city type and date. Also we've created a pivot table with the date and type for all three cities.
    Resample function by week to get the sum of all the fares for each week
    In the conclusion, we got an beautiful and professional a multiple-line chart using the Matplotlib function.
